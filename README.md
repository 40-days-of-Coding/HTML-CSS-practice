A 40 days coding challenge organised by Isaac Wilson. I decided to practice on my most loved and preferred software engineering 

# Frontend 

So in this challenge I would dedicate and put effort to develop my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JS(no idea for now lol)

I will be working on a site for Integrated Science Note for Senior High School in Ghana.
The purpose is to develop an assistant for students just like a student companion in Integrated Science; a core subject in Ghana and the most dreaded amongst the students I have had the opportunity to meet.


Let's start! Hmmm if not for this challenge, I don't think I would have started this at all. Those in this challenge with me( kurtiz, iswilsons, KBryt ) I'm going to disturb you like lol!
